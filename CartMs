TECHNICAL DESIGN PAGE CART MICROSERVICEâ€¦

OVERVIEW:
The CART Microservice is responsible for managing Cart-related functionalities and interactions.
Handles CRUD operations for carts and cart items.
Interacts with the database for data storage,including authentication, authorization.

ARCHITECTURE:
Programming Language: Java (Which Version?)
Framework: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL/AWS
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE:
RESTful API endpoints for communication.
It interacts with other microservices such as the Stock Microservice,
Order Microservice, and Authentication Microservice.

FUNCTIONALITY:

API Gateway:

Acts as a single entry point for client requests and routes them to the appropriate services, including the Cart Microservice.
Handles authentication and authorization through JWT.

Cart Service:

Manages cart-related functionalities and interactions.
Uses Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.
Handles CRUD operations for carts and cart items.
Interacts with the database (MongoDB) for data storage.

Workflow:
Adding Items to Cart:

User sends a POST request to the Cart Microservice's endpoint with product ID and quantity.
Cart Microservice adds the item to the cart in the database and responds with a success message.
Viewing Cart Details:

User sends a GET request to retrieve cart details.
Cart Microservice fetches the cart information from the database or cache, constructs a response, and sends it back to the user.
Modifying Cart Items:

User sends PATCH/DELETE requests to update or remove items from the cart.
Cart Microservice processes the request, updates the cart data accordingly in the database, and responds with a success message.
Checkout Process:

User initiates the checkout by sending a POST request.
Cart Microservice validates the cart, generates an order, and communicates with other microservices (e.g., Payment, Inventory) to complete the checkout process.
Notifications and Updates:

Cart Microservice publishes events related to cart changes (e.g., item added, quantity updated) to the message broker.
Other services subscribed to these events can take appropriate actions (e.g., sending notifications to users, updating inventory).
Synchronization and Caching:

Cart Microservice synchronizes carts across devices by updating the database and cache as users interact with their carts.

AUTHORIZATION:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
Define roles such as User or Admin.

SECURITY:
Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
Store passwords securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
Use JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.

ERROR HANDLING:
Define clear error messages and status codes for API responses.
Log errors for debugging purposes.

TESTING:
Implement unit testing with code coverage.
integration tests (if Required).
end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the microservice.

DOCUMENTATION:
Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

DEPLOYMENT:
Utilize continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
