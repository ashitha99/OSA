TECHNICAL DESIGN PAGE ADDRESS MICROSERVICE...
OVERVIEW:
The Address Microservice is responsible for managing address-related functionalities, including the creation, retrieval, and validation of addresses.

ARCHITECTURE:
Programming Language: Java (Java 8 or later)
Framework: Spring Boot
Database: MySQL/AWS (Choose based on specific requirements and preferences)
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE:
RESTful API endpoints for communication.
Interacts with other microservices such as the User Microservice, Order Microservice, and Authentication Microservice.

FUNCTIONALITY:
Address Creation:
Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses (POST): Allows users to create a new address.
Address Retrieval and Update:

Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses/{addressId} (GET): Retrieves details of a specific address.
Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses/{addressId} (PUT): Updates information about a specific address.
Address Deletion:

Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses/{addressId} (DELETE): Deletes a specific address.
Address List Retrieval:

Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses (GET): Retrieves a list of all addresses.
Address Update:

Endpoint: /osa/api/addresses/default_address (GET): Updates the default address

AUTHORIZATION:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
Define roles such as User or Admin.

SECURITY:
Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
Store address information securely.
Utilize proper validation to ensure data integrity.

ERROR HANDLING:
Define clear error messages and status codes for API responses.
Log errors for debugging purposes.

TESTING:
Implement unit testing with code coverage.
Integration tests (if required).
End-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the microservice.

DOCUMENTATION:
Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

DEPLOYMENT:
Utilize continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

FUTURE CONSIDERATION:
Consider features like address validation, geocoding integration, and additional search criteria.
